### Hi there 👋 

- 🔭 I'm Yevgenii, fresh graduate of the intensive 9-month Data Analysis program by Yandex [Practicum 100](https://www.practicum100.org/data-analysis) and [Masterschool ](https://www.linkedin.com/school/joinmasterschool/). Welcome to my GitHub page.

Soon I will upload all the projects that I did on Practicum 100.

# About me:

- 🌱  As of right now, I have successfully graduated from the intensive 9-month Data Analysis course from Yandex Practicum100 and Masterschool, where I completed numerous projects using Python (Pandas and NumPy), Excel, Relational Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL), EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), Data Visualization (Maplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly), Dashboards (Dash, Tableau), Automation, GitHub, A/B Testing, Machine Learning (Forecasting and Segmentation), KPIs, 12 real data-based projects. 

- 👯 This experience helped me gain a deeper understanding of the data, cultivate and practice such skills, as visualizing data and telling a story with insights to help managers make better decisions.

- :mortar_board: My degrees in Energy Management and Electrical Engineering have helped me to develop strong critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

- 🧐 The reason I chose Data Analytics is that I have an analytical mindset and enjoy organizing information and finding solutions to difficult problems. 

- ⚡ I am eager to begin my first challenging role in the field of analytics. I'd like to develop my skills and help businesses reach their goals.
